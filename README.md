I'm learning and testing verilog programming for applying at OpenROAD/OpenLane IC (digital integrated circuits) designs and pattern generator.

Along this repo, I'll uploading tests with his dependencies ('.v','.gds', and other files). The objetive of this repo is for first instance, learning and do test introducing verilog, and also post the result of the IC pattern generated viewed with KLayout. I'm fan of this tiny nano architecture cities on silicon :D
